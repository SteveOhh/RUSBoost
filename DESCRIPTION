Description: This package is an adaptation of the AdaBoost.M1 implementation
    from the 'adabag' package, which was authored by Esteban Alfaro-Cortes,
    Matias Gamez-Martinez and Noelia Garcia-Rubiorandom. RUSBoost is an
    algorithm created by Seiffert et al., which combines random undersampling
    and AdaBoost. My contribution was to integrate the undersampling component
    into the Adaboost function. Please see the 'adabag' package for more on how
    AdaBoost works.
